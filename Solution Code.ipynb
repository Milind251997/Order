    "**Problem Statement:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a Python program that reads the data stored in the provided rainfall.txt, where each line in the text file contains the name of a city, followed by whitespace, followed by the city's annual rainfall (in mm). Process this data so that it is grouped by annual rainfall into the following categories: [50-60 mm), [60-70 mm), [70-80 mm), [80-90 mm), [90-100 mm], and then sorted from lowest to highest rainfall within each category. Write this processed data to a new file called rain fall fmt.txt, so that under each category the city name is centered in a field that is 25 characters wide and is in all uppercase letters. The city name should be followed by its rainfall, right-aligned in a field that is 5 characters wide with I digit to the right of the decimal point."
